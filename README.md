# My State and COVID

There is a large amount of data concerning the COVID-19 Pandemic, from death rates, to infection, to ICU admissions, and recoveries. Up-to-date data presented in number form can be difficult to process for the human brain. My State and COVID aims to create a visualization of this data that easy to parse, separated by state.
