# My State and COVID
## Overview
There is a large amount of data concerning the COVID-19 Pandemic, from death rates, to infection, to ICU admissions, and recoveries. Up-to-date data presented in number form can be difficult to process for the human brain. My State and COVID aims to create a visualization of this data that easy to parse, separated by state.

## Functionality & MVP
My State and COVID users will be able to:
- Choose a state from the United States.
- See a visualization of the number of tests and infections for that state.
- Change categories to hospitalized, died, or ICU.
- Hover over the visualization to see raw numbers.

In addition, this project will have
- A link to the COVID Tracking Project with a short blurb on the work they do.
