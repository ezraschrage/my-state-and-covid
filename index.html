          <h3>Information and Purpose</h3>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every part of the United States.
            Thanks to the effort of the COVID Tracking Project, data is being
            actively collected to attempt to plot the course of the virus in real
            time. Data on its own can be difficult to visualize. My State and
            COVID presents a simple interface where you can see the data
            of a particular state. Every state has data on the test resuls and 
            the number of deaths attributable to
            COVID. A few states have data concerning the number of people
            hospitalized, on ventilators, in the ICU, and recovered. Next to 
            each state is a letter grade assigned by the COVID Tracking
            Project assessing the quality of the data available. This data is 
            updated daily from the COVID Tracking Project API.
